So, game devlopment was my biggest dream since I was in 10th standard because i was very curious that how this game works and what type application is used to develop such type of game. And that's the main reason for me choose computer filed, but unfortunately there is no subject like that.

But what I feel is that if you like particular app or language you can catch up to that language very quickly and in my case i like to develop my own game so if you hire me I will work very hard and easily understand all its concept and took less time learn.
